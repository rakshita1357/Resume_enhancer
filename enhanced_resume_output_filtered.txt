ORIGINAL: Alex Carter Technical developer with strong experience in building web apps, API systems, cloud-based tools and backend features. Worked on real projects involving automation, deployments and database management. - Backend: Python (FastAPI, Flask), Node.js (Express) - Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS - Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis - Core Concepts: REST APIs, authentication, JSON, microservices basics - DevOps: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Git - Cloud: AWS EC2, S3 basics - Tools: Postman, Linux commands, VS Code 1. API-Based Job Recommendation Engine Developed a system that collects job data using APIs, ranks jobs using filters and serves results through backend endpoints. 2. Automated Video Workflow Tool Created a backend service using Python and FFmpeg that compresses videos, extracts frames and generates small previews. 3. Inventory Management Dashboard Full-stack app for tracking items, sales and logs using React frontend and FastAPI backend. 4. DevOps Deployment Helper Made a small utility that generates Docker files, runs containers and checks service health. Software Developer Intern — TechNova Solutions (2024–2025) - Built backend APIs and integrated external services. - Improved performance of slow endpoints. - Fixed deployment errors in Docker services. Junior Web Developer — CodeSphere Labs (2025–Present) - Working on full-stack modules for live client projects. - Built dashboards, reports and optimized API layers. - Collaborated using Git, reviews and CI/CD tools. - Completed 12+ technical projects. - Improved API response time for internal service by 25%. - Runner-up in internal hackathon for automation project.
